## Overview

This puzzle game offers a unique daily challenge based on the current date. Players are presented with a board that displays today's date, month, and day of the week. The goal is to strategically place all puzzle pieces on the board while avoiding these restricted cells. For example, if today is "MON 25 DEC", those cells cannot be covered by any pieces. Players can also choose a different date to solve puzzles from the past or future, making it an evergreen challenge with 365 different possibilities throughout the year. The game combines spatial reasoning with calendar awareness for an engaging and mentally stimulating experience.
